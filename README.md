### Routing to address - How to find us 

A popular feature of this extension is 'Routing to address'.  

1. Fill the information in the tabulator 'Routing to address'.
- If you like to use address suggestions you should use a positon on the top.  
- Per default [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/) is used as router. OSRM is sometimes busy. If you like to 
use mapbox you have to get an access token: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/

2. In front end you see a text field

If you enter a address in the text field in the front end and click enter you see
a route to the address you entered in the back end.
