### Routing to address - How to find us 

A popular feature of this extension is 'Routing to address'.  

1. Fill the information in the tabulator 'Routing to address'.
- If you like to use address suggestions you should use a positon on the top.  
- Per default [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/) is used as router. OSRM is sometimes busy. If you like to 
use mapbox you have to get an access token: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/

2. In front end you see a text field

If you enter a address in the text field in the front end and click enter you see
a route to the address you entered in the back end.

### Show markers on a map that link to an article - you can enter the coordinate in a Custom Field

#### Custom Field of the type text

The next picture shows what the map might look like. If the markers are too close together, 
they will be clustered. If the resolution of the card fits, the marker will be displayed. 
A click on the marker opens a popup. In this popup there is a link to the post - link text is 
the title of the article.

![Home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9974686/58746148-263e0580-845b-11e9-8b30-374c4256f46e.png)


Do you want to display a marker on a map that contains a link to an article? 
Then create a Custom Field of the type text titled `lat, lon`. 
Be sure to write the title in the same way - the space after the comma is important. 
Any article with the custom field filled with a correct coordinate will be displayed on the map. 

![Articles  Fields   test   Administration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9974686/58746149-26d69c00-845b-11e9-920b-f5309b98ff37.png)

If you want to use different colors or icons, you can fill the custom field with the title `lat, lon` as 
follows: `lat,lon,markercolor,iconcolor,icon`. 
As color, you can choose red, darkred, orange, green, darkgreen, blue, purple, darkpurple and cardetblue. 
For the icon you can choose the name of the Font Awesome Icon. 
For more informations see https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery.

When you enter `50.150, 7.158, red, green, home` you will see an icon as shown in the next picture.

Just select the option `Do not automatically display` in the Custom Field options.
