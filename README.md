# pkg_agosm 

The installation files are in the [Releases section](https://github.com/astridx/pkg_agosms/releases). 

There are independent versions for Joomla 3 and for Joomla 4. I have now numbered the versions of agosms so that 3.x and smaller is for Joomla 3. The version 4.x is for Joomla 4.

> The version for Joomla 4 cannot be used as an update for Joomla 3.

# Support and new functions

This Joomla! extension is a simple feature. But it is very likely that your requirements 
are already covered or require very little customisation.

If you have more complex requirements, need new features or just need some support, 
I am open to paid customisation and support around this Joomla! extension. 

Contact me and we'll work it out!
