# Support and New Features

This Joomla! Extension is a simple feature. But it is most likely, that your requirements are 
already covered or require very little adaptation.

If you have more complex requirements, need new features or just need some support, 
I am open to doing paid custom work and support around this Joomla! Extension. 

Contact me and we'll sort this out!
